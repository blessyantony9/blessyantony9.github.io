I am a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg in the Department of Computer Science. I am a part of the Computational Systems Biology Lab and am advised by Dr. T. M. Murali. 

My research interests include solving impactful problems in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics using Graph Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Currently, I am using language models to draw information from viral genome and study the evolution of zoonotic viruses. 

Prior to starting graduate school, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at University of Mumbai, India in 2016. Thereafter, I worked as a Software Engineer for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. at Mumbai for four years. The industrial experience helped me hone my software development skills and learn about the journey of an application from proof-of-concept to the deployment in production.

I am open to internship or co-op positions with research-oriented roles in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.
