I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA. I am co-advised by [Dr. T. M. Murali](https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~murali/) and [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://anujkarpatne.github.io/). 

My research interests include solving impactful problems in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics using Natural Language Processing and Graph Machine Learning. Currently, I am using language models to draw information from viral genome and study the evolution of viruses. 

Prior to starting graduate school, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at University of Mumbai, India in 2016. Thereafter, I worked as a Software Engineer for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. at Mumbai for four years. The industrial experience helped me hone my software development skills and learn about the journey of an application from proof-of-concept to deployment in production.
